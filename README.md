# password-generator
<p> Password generator is an application that gives you a number of prompts and from your responses will generate a password. This was an assignment to help us gain practice in using conditional statements and for loops. The biggest problem I had was figuring out a way to have the code include, or more importantly, not include certain characters based on your responses to the prompts. I solved it by using the concat method and adding arrays of characters into a larger array. That larger array was put through a for loop that randomly selected an index and that index was put into the password. </p>
